## Advanced stuff

### How to deal with more cores

**Paralelism**: CPU Bound => Multi Processing

- you're running stuff in pararel and taking advante of multiple CPUs

**Concurency**: I/O Bound, Fast I/O, Limited Number of Connections => Multi Threading

- concurently running more tasks on one thread, context switching

**Ansynchro**: I/O Bound, Slow I/O, Many connections => Asyncio

- using async/awats, waiting thread can let futher code continue executing and the results from awaiting one are either received or needed
 
NOTE: low level languages such as C/C++, C#, Java achieve native paralelism computing by using threads, higher ones such as *SnekTM*üêç and Google's abonimation of Go locks down interpreters (GIL) and forces you to use futher libraries (Multiprocessing) or tidious workarounds ((G|c)orutines)
