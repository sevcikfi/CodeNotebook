## Advanced stuff

### How to deal with more cores

**Parallelism**: CPU Bound => Multi Processing

- you're running stuff in parallel and taking advance of multiple CPUs

**Concurrency**: I/O Bound, Fast I/O, Limited Number of Connections => Multi Threading

- concurrently running more tasks on one thread, context switching

**Ansynchro**: I/O Bound, Slow I/O, Many connections => Asyncio

- using async/awaits, waiting thread can let further code continue executing and the results from awaiting one are either received or needed

NOTE: low level languages such as C/C++, C#, Java achieve native parallelism computing by using threads, higher ones such as *SnekTM*üêç and Google's abomination of Go locks down interpreters (GIL) and forces you to use further libraries (Multiprocessing) or tedious workarounds ((G|c)routines)
